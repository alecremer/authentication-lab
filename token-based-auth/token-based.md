# Working

- The user sends a login request to the server.

- The server authorizes the login and sends a token to the user.

- Now, the user sends a new request(with a token).

- The server checks the token is valid or not, if the token is valid it sends the requested pages to the user.

Note- Those are not authentication files, they are authorization ones. While receiving a token, the server does not look up who the user is, it simply authorizes the userâ€™s requests relying on the validity of the token.


Usually JWTs (JSON Web Token) are used for this
